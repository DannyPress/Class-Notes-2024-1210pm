    "    - [ ] open an issue in a repo to get help  \n",
    "    - [ ] know what a good `README` file does and can look like - [I _personally_ like this one](https://GitHub.com/donbowen/BFH) but take a quick look at [this  list of awesome readmes](https://GitHub.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) for inspiration \n",

    "| 0. **PLAN BEFORE YOU CODE** | A. \"Pseudo code\" is writing out the broad steps in plain language. I often (almost always for complicated tasks) do this on paper, then translate it to code as an outline (in the code's comments). <br> <br> Maybe planning sounds boring and like a waste of time. I get it; I also want to [shoot first](https://youtu.be/la7uuFsCIrg?t=43) like [Han did...](https://youtu.be/YtoqDF8EnsA)  but coders like Han often [end up looking like this guy](https://youtu.be/mLyOj_QD4a4?t=67)... |\n",
    "| | B. Break the problem into chunks/smaller problems. Large chunks should be in different script files. Within an individual file that is doing one thing, try to break it down. See rule 3.A and 5.B below too. |\n",
    "| 1. Automation | A. Automate everything that can be automated, don't do point-and-click analysis! |\n",
    "| | B. If the project involves running multiple code files in order, write a single script that executes all code for the project from beginning to end, [like this one.](10_Golden_6.html#part-3-making-replication-easy) |\n",
    "| 2. Version control | A. Store code and data under version control.  |\n",
    "| | B. [Use the Github workflow!](../01/03a_githubworkflow) | \n",
    "| | C. **Before checking the directory back in, clear all outputs, delete temp files, and then run the whole directory to make sure the outputs reproduce!** (Check: Did it work right?) <br> <br> [If the project uses notebook files, always look to see if the first executed code block has \"[1]\" next to it and that all the subsequent code blocks are numbered consecutively.](../01/06_python.html?highlight=golden#clear-output-and-rerun-from-the-start)   |\n",
    "| 3.  [Organizing folders](10_Golden_6) | A. Separate  folders/directories and files by function |\n",
    "| | B. Put input files into an input folder and outputs into a different folder  |\n",
    "| | A + B = your folders and files will be largely self-documenting |\n",
    "| | C. Make directories portable - they should run on any computer, or if you move them to another place on your computer. See the next rule. |\n",
